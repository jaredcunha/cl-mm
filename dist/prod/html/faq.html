						<h3>I’m already an LS merchant, do I need to apply in order to participate in Restaurants Plus?</h3>
						<p>Yep, but it’s super-easy. Head <a href="http://info.livingsocialbusiness.com/plus">here</a> to start the application process.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq__item">
						<h3>How does Restaurants Plus work?</h3>
						<p>It’s simple: A customer joins our Restaurants Plus program by linking a credit or debit card to our system. When the card is used at a partnering restaurant, we’ll reward the cardholder with cashback savings.</p>
						<p>As a merchant, you’ll have control over how much and when to discount, which means you can set higher discounts at specific days and times to encourage business when it’s slow. Pretty sweet, right?</p>
	    				<p>Other than that, no additional work is required from you or your staff. The savings for your customers are automatic—no vouchers, no hassle.</p>
	    				<p>Each month, LivingSocial will provide a detailed report on the ROI of the program, including information about revenue and the number of customers (new and returning). The report also highlights marketing metrics such as email mentions, search views, and app/web views. You’ll be able to track exactly how much business Restaurants Plus is helping you bring in.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq__item">
						<h3>Is Restaurants Plus an additional charge for existing customers?</h3>
						<p>No, there will be no charge for customers. They will be required to register (free of charge) for Restaurants Plus at LivingSocial via desktop or mobile applications.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq__item">
						<h3>What is a Cashback Reward?</h3>
						<p>Once consumers reach a $10 payback balance, they’re eligible for a monthly payment in the amount they’ve accrued. Payment is automatically credited back to the activated payback card. If the account balance has not yet reached $10, payment rolls over to the next month (until the balance reaches $10).</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq__item">
						<h3>Why is this appealing to customers?</h3>
						<p>As easy as it is for you, it’s even easier for customers. They’re going to discover great new restaurants throughout the area––and save cash when they visit them. Plus, they’ll receive these savings automatically on their next billing statement. No fiddling with phones or paper vouchers—just eat, pay, and save.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq__item">
						<h3>Do I have to pay any additional fees to LS?</h3>
						<p>There are no upfront fees to join the network. When we drive a customer to use Restaurants Plus at your restaurant, we charge you a percentage of the total after-tax bill (tips excluded).</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq__item">
						<h3>What types of businesses can join Restaurant Plus?</h3>
						<p>Basically, any place that serves food. Here are some examples:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Dine-in restaurants, quick-service restaurants, etc.</li>
							<li>bars and clubs</li>
							<li>cafes and coffee shops</li>
							<li>Ice cream and frozen yogurt shops</li>
						</ul>

					</div>
					<div class="faq__item">
						<h3>Does Restaurants Plus require any extra equipment or software?</h3>
						<p>If you accept credit cards, Restaurants Plus requires no additional hardware or equipment. Customers use their activated credit cards to pay for meals through your existing credit card reader, and LivingSocial takes care of the rest. However, the program isn’t available for cash transactions or online orders.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq__item">
						<h3>Will my staff require special training in order to utilize Restaurants Plus?</h3>
						<p>Nope, because Restaurants Plus customers will behave like all other customers. No vouchers, remember? They pay full price at the end of the meal, and LivingSocial takes care of the rest. No additional training, work, or effort will be needed from you or your staff.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq__item">
						<h3>Can customers order through a delivery or order service?</h3>
						<p>At this time, the program is available only through our restaurants on-premise credit card machines. Sorry!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq__item">
						<h3>Who can I call if I have more questions about this program?</h3>
						<p>Please call Merchant Services at 866-578-2039, and we’ll answer any questions you have about being featured as a Plus Restaurant. We’d love to hear from you!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq__item">
						<h3>Are there mechanisms in place to prevent discount stacking? We’re worried that customers will use Restaurants Plus at the same time they take advantage of other promotions.</h3>
						<p>The best way to prevent this from happening is to turn off other voucher and card-linked programs. At this time, this is the best means of preventing discount stacking. </p>
						<p>However, if you are concerned about a specific redemption please give our Merchant Service team a call at 866-578-2039, and we’ll work with you to answer any questions.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq__item">
						<h3>Are there mechanisms to ensure that customers receive a discount if they come in during the discounted time but pay just after the discount window ends? For example, what happens if a customer comes in for an offer valid from 2 to 4 p.m. and swipes the card at 4:15 p.m.?</h3>
						<p>This is a little trickier, but you don’t have to worry about it. The customer simply has to call our customer service team at 866-578-2039 and have the receipt from the transaction handy for verification. We’ll help take care of any necessary adjustments––you don’t have to do anything. </p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq__item">
						<h3>Can I discount specific parts of the business or offer more detailed offers through this model? For example, I’d like to offer 20% off appetizers in the wine bar between 4 and 5 p.m.</h3>
						<p>At this time, this isn’t possible. We’ve designed Restaurants Plus so that customers will seek you out in a way that allows you to serve them seamlessly. It’s good for them and easy for you. We do all the work, after all!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq__item">
						<h3>Is there any way to limit the number of people in a party that can use a specific Restaurants Plus discount? </h3>
						<p>You don’t have to worry about this, because anyone who pays with an activated card receives the agreed-upon discount, which you have the ability to control.</p>
						<p>If one Restaurants Plus member pays for multiple people in a given party, the discount will be applied to his or her card, but it will never exceed the percentage you have set.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq__item">
						<h3>Can merchants limit the number of discounted customers in a given period of time?</h3>
						<p>At this time, this isn’t an option, but we’d love to help you determine the optimal way to make Restaurants Plus work for you. Give the folks from our Merchant Services team a call at 866-578-2039, and they’ll be happy to help you with any concerns.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq__item">
						<h3>How does exposure on this tool work?  How will customers find my offer?  How will this help drive customer engagement? </h3>
						<p>This is the fun part: We can do a lot to help customers find you. Customers will discover your promotion via LivingSocial's web and mobile channels, as well as through direct email marketing campaigns.</p>
						<p>Restaurants Plus is a brand-new beta product that’s exclusive to LivingSocial, and we don’t think our competitors have anything that compares. It can help you generate a considerable amount of valuable exposure––with no effort on your part. We’re thrilled to be rolling it out, and think you’ll be excited too when you see it in action.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq__item">
						<h3>Will customers who are visiting the area be able to find my restaurant on Restaurants Plus?</h3>
						<p>We’re so glad you asked! Restaurants Plus members can access the list of all restaurants that participate in the program via web or smartphone, so they’ll be able to find your business anytime they’re in your area.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq__item">
						<h3>Where can I see information about how many customers Restaurants Plus has brought to my restaurant?</h3>
						<p>You’ll receive a monthly ROI report that provides revenue stats, as well as the number of new and returning customers who have visited your restaurant. </p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq__item">
						<h3>Will I know when Restaurants Plus customers are in my restaurant? Will I know when a Restaurants Plus transaction has taken place?</h3>
						<p>Since you’ll only know a customer is using Restaurants Plus when he or she pays the bill, it’s not possible to determine whether someone is using the program until the bill is paid.</p>
						<p>We think this is great, though, because it keeps both you and the customer from worrying about redeeming vouchers, keeping track of vouchers, etc.</p>
						<p>You’ll still receive regular information about when Restaurants Plus transactions are taking place, so it’ll be easy to keep track of how it’s working.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="faq__item">
						<h3>Will I be able to see details of party size and consumer behavior in the ROI reporting? I’d like information about customer behavior patterns, not just the size of the discount. </h3>
						<p>LivingSocial has access to the bill amount and card-specific attributes. For example, we can tell you how many times the card was used over a given period of time, or whether the card has been used at your restaurant before. </p>
